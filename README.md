# Reaction Tester

## 🚀 About the Project
Reaction Tester is a simple web-based game that tests users' reaction speed by displaying a randomly appearing shape. Users must click the shape as fast as possible to improve their reaction time.

## 🎮 How to Play
1. The game starts automatically when you open the page.
2. Click on the randomly appearing shape as quickly as possible.
3. The shape will change position, color, size, and border radius each time.
4. The game runs for **30 seconds**.
5. Your **score** and **best reaction time** are displayed.
6. Once time runs out, the game ends, and your final score is shown.
